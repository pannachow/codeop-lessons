/*------------------
1)
Create an array called "numbers"
and include the numbers zero
through five. 

The console.log statement is checking
if you are correct.
------------------*/

const numbers = [
  0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
];

console.log("Question #1 ", numbers.reduce((a, b) => a + b) === 15 ? "is correct." : "is incorrect.");

/*------------------
2)
Print Sofia's age to the console.
------------------*/

    relationship: "school",
    age: 30
  },

/*------------------
3)
"Tuesday" is in the wrong
place. Take it out using the .splice
method, and add it back in using the
.splice method.

Hint: when you do this, you shouldn't
have to retype "Tuesday". Assign it to
a variable when you remove it so that
you can add it back in using the
variable name.
------------------*/

const weekDays = ["Sunday", "Tuesday", "Monday", "Wednesday"];

4)
Add the rest of the weekdays
to the weekDays array by using the
.push method.
------------------*/

weekDays.push("Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday");
console.log("Question #4 ", weekDays[6] === "Saturday" ? "is correct." : "is incorrect.");

/*------------------
5)
Print all of the items in the 
weekDays array as a string, with
each item seperated with a comma.

Hint: This will use a method you don't
know yet. Figure it out by doing an
Internet search for "create comma separated
string from array javascript". DO NOT USE LOOPS.
------------------*/

const listOfWeekDays = weekDays.join(", ");

console.log(`The days in the week are ${listOfWeekDays}.`);

/*------------------
6)
Change the array so it starts
with Monday and ends with Sunday
instead. To do this, use two methods
from the following list:
.push
.pop
.shift
.unshift

Hint: when you remove "Sunday" from
the beginning of the array, assign it
to a variable so you don't lose it.
DO NOT USE LOOPS.
------------------*/

const sun = weekDays.shift();

console.log("Question #6 ", weekDays[6] === "Sunday" ? "is correct." : "is incorrect.");

/*------------------
7)
Now, using some of the methods
from the last question, create a
new array with all the items in the
weekDays array reversed. 

Hint: figure out how to make a copy
of the weekDays array. Then, use some of
the methods you learned to remove items
from that copy and add into the reversedWeekDays
array. DO NOT USE LOOPS.
------------------*/

const reversedWeekDays = [
  weekDays.pop(),
  weekDays.pop(),
  weekDays.pop(),
  weekDays.pop(),
  weekDays.pop(),
  weekDays.pop(),
  weekDays.pop()
];

/*------------------
8)
Let's do this again. This time, reverse
the writtenNumbers – but do it in ONE
line of code.

Hint: there is a method to reverse all
the items in an array. Do an Internet search
or explore the MDN docs to figure this out.
------------------*/

const writtenNumbers = ["one", "two", "three", "four", "five"];
writtenNumbers.reverse();

console.log(writtenNumbers);

/*------------------
9)
Take each item off the front of the
num array, multiply that item
by 7, and add it to the numTimesSeven
array. DO NOT USE LOOPS.
------------------*/

const num = [1, 2, 3];

const numTimesSeven = [
  num.shift() * 7,
  num.shift() * 7,

/*------------------
10)
Find out if the id "1x3v6umb0i9p" is
included in the listOfIDs array. You can
do this in one line of code (assign the answer
true or false to a variable called "includesID").

Hint: it may be easiest to figure this out
using the MDN docs– or including "ES6" in your
search query (the array method for this was
added in a more recent version of JavaScript).

11)
Print the last ID in the list of IDs

a calculation which includes the length

do an internet search :)
