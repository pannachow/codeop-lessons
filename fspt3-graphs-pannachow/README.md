# Graphs

In this repository, you will practice writing a graph class.

## Objectives

  - Create a class for a graph data structure.
  - Create common methods included in a graph.
  - Practice recursion.

## Setup

Run `yarn` to install packages.
Run `yarn test` to run tests.

## Basic Requirements

### 1. Complete the Graph class.
  - [ ] First, look at the tests! This will help you
      figure out what methods you need to write.
      - Note that some of the tests are in pending
        mode. Ignore those for now.
  - [ ] Once you are ready to add your methods, pseudocode
      the steps of your solution. This will help you stay on
      track with what you need to write.
