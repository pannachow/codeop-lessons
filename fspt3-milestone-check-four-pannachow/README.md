# Full Stack Development Test - Week Four

This assessment tests your understanding of creating a front-end from React or Vue.

## Set up

### Initial

Run `yarn` to install packages. Then, choose a framework (either Vue or React), and follow the instructions below.

### For VUE

`cd vue`. Run `npm install` to install packages and `npm run serve` to run your development build.

The app will run on `http://localhost:8080` as the default port.

### For React

`cd react`. Run `yarn` to install packages and `yarn start` to run your development build.

The app will run on `http://localhost:3000` as the default port.

## Basic Requirements

Create a to-do list with the following functionality:

- [ ] A list of items.
  - At least three should be prefilled.
- [ ] A form to add new items.
  - After clicking a button and/or hitting enter, the new item should be added to the list.
- [ ] A way to cross out items from the list when it is clicked on.
  - The styling for this is your choice – you can have a color change, a styling change (e.g. strikethrough) or something else. However, it should be clear that the item in the to do list is complete.
- [ ] (Bonus - optional) Can you make it so the list of items is always alphabetically ordered?

## Guidelines

- For this test you **cannot** look at the class slides.
- You **can** use notes that you have taken.
- **You cannot look at code you have previously written**.
- The only resources you may use online are:
  - [MDN docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/)
  - [Vue docs](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/)
  - [React docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html)
- Make sure you give yourself a grade before turning it in!

## Tips

- Use your whiteboard to draw the problem.
- Write pseudocode before writing code.

## Self-Assessment

Give yourself a grade for each question. Explain why you gave yourself that grade.

| Grade | Explanation                                                        |
| :---: | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
|   4   | I understood this completely and did not struggle answering it.    |
|   3   | I think I did well, but I didn't totally understand why it worked. |
|   2   | I think I was close, but I didn't get the answer.                  |
|   1   | I am struggling with this question.                                |
|   0   | I did not attempt this question (explain why)                      |

### 1. To Do List

- Grade: 3 
- Explanation: I think I still need to work on more exercise of React. Still feeling very confused about it.
