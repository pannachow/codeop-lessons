# Looping through Arrays

In this repository, you will practice looping through arrays.

## Objectives

  - Loop through arrays.
  - Loop through nested arrays.
  - Loop through JSON.

## Basic Requirements

Complete all of the questions in the `challenges.js` file.

### 1. Open the file in your browser
  - [ ] Open the `index.html` file.
    - Note where this file connects to the JavaScript file.
    - Open the file in your browser.
    - Open the JavaScript console to see the results of your code.

### 2. Answer all of the challenges.
  - [ ] Answer each question in the challenges file.
  - [ ] When you are done answering, comment it out!
    - To comment out a line, use `//` in front of the line, or encapsulate the entire line with `*/ code /*`.

### Commit early, commit often!
  - [ ] After each major change, make a commit to Github. Here's a [cheat sheet](https://www.git-tower.com/blog/git-cheat-sheet) for commands and tips for writing good commit messages.
    - `git status` checks for changes (optional)
    - `git add .` adds all files 
    - `git commit -m"MESSAGE"` adds commit message
