# Introduction

In every repository, you will have a README.md file at the root level that will be used to convey important instructions. `md` stands for `markdown`, and is easily recognized for formatting.

## Objectives

- Use Markdown syntax.
- Navigate files using the command line.
- Make proper commit messages.

## Add plugin to VSCode\*

This will help you follow markdown rules

- Goto Extensions of VSCode
- Search for `DavidAnson.vscode-markdownlint`
- Restart VSCode

## Basic Requirements

Write a short page introducing yourself to the rest of the class. Use the command line to do this!

### 1. Create your page

- Use the command line to create a new file- title it `profile.md`. Tips for navigating the command line:
  - `cd <nameOfFolder>` navigate into a folder
  - `cd ..` go back a level
  - `ls` display everything in the folder
  - `touch <nameOfFile` make new file
  - `mkdir <nameOfFolder>` make new folder

### 2. Add information about yourself

- First, read the [syntax rules for md files](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
- In your page, include the following information:
  - Why you are taking this class
  - What your favorite things are (or what you hope to visit) in Barcelona
  - What your professional background is
  - What your previous experiences with coding are
  - Some fun facts about yourself
- Make sure you include the following:
  - An image (bonus if you can add it to this repo instead of linking from elsewhere online)
  - Different types of headers
  - A bulleted list
  - A link

### 3. Commit early, commit often

- After each major change, make a commit to Github. Here's a [cheat sheet](https://www.git-tower.com/blog/git-cheat-sheet) for commands and tips for writing good commit messages.
  - `git status` checks for changes (optional)
  - `git add .` adds all files
  - `git commit -m"MESSAGE"` adds commit message
  - `git push` pushes changes
