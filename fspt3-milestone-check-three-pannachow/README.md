- Write pseudocode before you start writing the program
- Make sure you give yourself a grade before turning it in!

## Tips

- Use your whiteboard to draw the problem.
- Write pseudocode before writing code.

## Self-Assessment

Give yourself a grade for each question. Explain why you gave yourself that grade.

| Grade | Explanation                                                        |
| :---: | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
|   4   | I understood this completely and did not struggle answering it.    |
|   3   | I think I did well, but I didn't totally understand why it worked. |
|   2   | I think I was close, but I didn't get the answer.                  |
|   1   | I am struggling with this question.                                |
|   0   | I did not attempt this question (explain why)                      |

### 1. Traverse Binary Tree

Complete the binary_tree.js so that all unit tests in \_binary_tree.js pass.
Add 2 additional tests for this function.

- Grade: 3
- Explanation: I am still confused about the closure. Still don't really understand why it is needed to be `traverse(this);`.

### 2. DOM Manipulation

Complete all questions in the index.js and styles.css of the 'dom-manipulation' folder.

- Grade: 3
- Explanation: For the adding image part, I was a bit lost so I looked up on the internet and finish Q4.
