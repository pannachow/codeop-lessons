# Queues and Stacks

In this repository, you will practice writing a Queue and Stack class.

## Objectives

  - Create a Queue class and Stack class.
  - Create tests.

## Setup

Run `yarn` to install packages.
Run `yarn test` to run tests.

## Basic Requirements

### 1. Complete the Queue class.
  - [ ] Complete the Queue class, passing all tests.

### 2. Complete the Stack class.
  - [ ] Create tests for the Stack class.
    - Make sure you really write the correct tests for this– it is
    different than the Queue class, and the wrong tests will make
    you write the wrong code!
    - Feel free to check in with the instructor after this step to make
    sure you are on thr right track.
  - [ ] Complete the Stack class, passing all tests.
