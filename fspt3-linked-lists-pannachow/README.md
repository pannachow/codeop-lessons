# Linked Lists

In this repository, you will practice writing a linked list.

## Objectives

  - Create a class for a linked list.
  - Create common methods included in a linked list.

## Setup

Run `yarn` to install packages.
Run `yarn test` to run tests.

## Basic Requirements

### 1. Complete the LinkedList class.
  - [ ] First, look at the tests! This will help you
      figure out what methods you need to write.
      - Note that some of the tests are in pending
        mode. Ignore those for now.
  - [ ] Once you are ready to add your methods, pseudocode
      the steps of your solution. This will help you stay on
      track with what you need to write.

### 2. Complete the pending tests as well.
  - [ ] After you pass all of the tests, get rid of the `x` on the
    additional tests that currently say "pending".
      - Now, go back to your methods and write code to handle
        edge cases so that all of these other tests pass!
